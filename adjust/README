This directory contains scripts to adjust the existing GEOS-FP data files 
as follows:

(1) Files will be renamed from GEOS572*.nc to GEOSFP*.nc

(2) Attributes have been modified for COARDS compliance:
    (a) The "time" dimension now has an attribute: calendar="gregorian"
    (b) We now use global attribute "Conventions" instead of "conventions"
    (c) Variables having a units attribute of "unitless" or "fraction"
        now carry a units attribute of "1".

(3) Each file now contains only one vertical dimension.  This will facilitate
    the standalone Grid-Independent GEOS-Chem using ESMF/MAPL.  The MAPL
    netCDF read & regrid  routines cannot handle more than one vertical
    dimension per netCDF file.

(4) The CMFMC file is now moved from the A3dyn to the A3mstE file.  A3mstE
    now contains all GEOS-Chem met fields on level edges.
